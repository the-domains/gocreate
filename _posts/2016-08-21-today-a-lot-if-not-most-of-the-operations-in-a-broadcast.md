  Today a lot - if not most - of the operations in a broadcast facility are
  driven by IT. Whether you are running a studio, post-production facility or an
  OB-Van, you’re likely to use computers, servers, networks, … to get things
  done. Operating, monitoring and proactively maintaining this kind of
  infrastructure is a time consuming operation, certainly when the main focus is
  not the IT but the actual production and its creative endeavour.   GoCreate
  can help you manage your IT-infrastructure from start to finish and can
  off-load the management if your infrastructure both partially or even
  completely.  We can do monitoring, alerting, patching of your hard- and
  software and can even take care of the proactive maintenance as system
  recovery in case of a system failure would occur. IF needed we can even
  provide help-desk services for your end-users.
