  GoCreate is Dietrich De Bruyne. I am a 31 year old Broadcast/IT-Engineer from
  Heverlee (Leuven region) in Belgium.  Since 2005 I have been active as a
  broadcast engineer, at that time, full-time employed at Headline NFP in
  Brussels where I was a satellite-engineer (SNG-truck operator) and later did a
  lot of project management for Outside Broadcast operations together with
  technical installation planning and follow-up; my biggest project at Headline
  being the construction of the Euronews office in 2011 from start to finish. 
  Since 2009 Iâ€™ve started my freelance activities at GoCreate, with as a main
  objective offering global solutions to the emerging broadcast market as a
  freelance independent consultant. My other and maybe biggest passion
  (professionally) is the domain of IT-technology. I am crazy about how things
  work and co-exist and how to make workflows function as optimal as they can. 
  Broadcast-technology is more than ever IT-driven and I have the pleasure of
  being able to combine both into my daily job.  For the operational side, I
  work together with several companies, both freelance individuals like myself
  together with well-established companies in the industry.  The main goal of my
  work, and partnerships with colleagues, has always been a customer-centric
  approach, the right solution for the right problem/demand and a no-nonsense
  strategy. The goal is getting things done, the way you need them to be done.
